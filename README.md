Howdy! I decided it would be fun to build an opensource website. It has been a blast sipping coffee in the evenings while creating this
and doing some collaboration with my friends at work.

Feel free to look through this as examples! I'm not going to say I know everything, but I did manage to get the various frameworks working together!

## PokePeru

This website is built with node v20.9.0. Please download the repo: https://github.com/jeffski13/jeffDotSki. Navigate to the downloaded repo in the terminal and install and start:

``` bash
npm install

npm start
```

In the browser, go to http://localhost:5173/pokePeru/battle

For info on modifying the project with your students' monsters, please see http://localhost:5173/pokePeru/info.

## Deploying

I created a script that will run the build, copying into the local Firebase directory, and deploying to the firebase servers. It has made me want to update my site more! [deployski.sh](./deployski.sh)
