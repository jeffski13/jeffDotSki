Howdy! I decided it would be fun to build an opensource website. It has been a blast sipping coffee in the evenings while creating this
and doing some collaboration with my friends at work.

Feel free to look through this as examples! I'm not going to say I know everything, but I did manage to get the various frameworks working together!

## Deploying

I created a script that will run the build, copying into the local Firebase directory, and deploying to the firebase servers. It has made me want to update my site more! [deployski.sh](./deployski.sh)
